                The moral compass in the show. A great guy. I have to say, it's extremely hard to be him given the little scene time he had. In tv shows, with so many characters and episodes, it's hard to develop a white knight, especially from the beginning. Audiences could feel bored, but the writers in this show did hell of a good job to explore Helo.
