            <p>
                I have to say that I am not a big fan of her from time to time. I know she is special and all that, but I sometimes cannot get over the rebellious and contemptuous attitudes and actions of her. But I love that she is a great character, one in a million. Suffice to say, I love her as a character but I don't dare to make friends with her in real life.
