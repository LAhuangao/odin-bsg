                The acting and plot of this character are magnificent! To be honest, I don't like Roslin at all, at least in later seasons. She stepped out as a leader in the beginning and tried to do everything for the greater good. The religious fanatics sides of her confused me and the hatred of Baltar kinda turned her into a dark person, alone and hopeless. Along with her self-righteousness and condescension, she became a person of power and cruelty. Perhaps, the presidency did something to her, or the drugs she used changed her somehow. Almost all her actions are delusional and ridiculous. Of course she is the dying leader. But, what if she is not the dying leader? That being said, everyone is dying, right? She was so sure of her fate that she risked the fate of humans almost every time she got. Nevertheless, the actor was so good and the character development is great.
